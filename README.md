# FuzzyInferenceGui
Simple Gui to illustrate Fuzzy inference using python libraries


Membership functions and fuzzy based rules are refrenced from the following paper.
Awan, Malik Shahzad Kaleem, and Mian Muhammad Awais. "Predicting weather events using fuzzy rule based system." Applied Soft Computing 11.1 (2011): 56-63.

There are some innacuracies in the results given the fuzzy ruleset is incomplete. However it is to illustrate the concept of fuzzy inference for weather prediction
